Maturity

Duration = weighted average maturity of CashFlow from a Bond = sum PV(CF)/BondValue
  dPrice/dInterestRate = Bond Price interest rate sensitivity
MacaulayDuration = time-weighted average maturity of CashFlow from a Bond = sum( Time*PV(CF) )/BondValue 
  coupon bond < Maturity
  zero coupon bond = maturity
ModifiedDuration = MacaulayDuration/(1+YTM/k), k=compounding frequency
  dP/dYTM =- ModifiedDuration *dYTM

PriceValue of a basis point
 
EffectorDuration = take into account optionality, or use Market Price = (dP/P)/(dr/100 basisPt)
