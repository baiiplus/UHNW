Maturity

Bond = sum PV(CF), by spot rate

Bond Risk factors = senstitiy to interest rate
                  = sentitity to key rate shift
                  = sentitivy + convexity
                  = OAS option adjusted spread

    Duration = weighted average maturity of CashFlow from a Bond = sum PV(CF)/BondValue
      % dPrice / dYield = (dPrice/Price) / (dYield) = -D,
      dPrice = -D x Price x dYield
      dInterestRate = Bond Price interest rate sensitivity
    MacaulayDuration = time-weighted average maturity of CashFlow from a Bond = sum( Time*PV(CF)/BondValue )
      coupon bond < Maturity
      zero coupon bond = maturity
    ModifiedDuration = MacaulayDuration/(1+YTM/k), k=compounding frequency
      dP/dYTM =- ModifiedDuration *dYTM

    Key Rate Duration
      % dPrice / dKeyRate = (dPrice/Price) / (dKeyRate) = -DKeyRate, e.g. any KeyRate at a maturity
      dPrice/dKeyRate = -DkeyRate x Price = -DkeyRate x PV(CF)
      DkeyRate = (dPrice/Price)/dKeyRate
    EffectorDuration = take into account optionality, or use Market Price = (dP/P)/(dr/100 basisPt)
