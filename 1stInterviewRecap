Knock-Out bull equity-linked bull note (Basket and KO)
Key Risk
- Market risk of the underlyings, based on joined probability that of 3 equities move towards KO or move below initial discounted prices
- Liquidity risk, usually held to maturity
- Redemption risk, principle is not protected
- Price is slightly higher relative to single-equity-linked because strikes are basket-of-and conditioned, which has a slighty lower probability due to lower correlation or diversification effect
- Price is discounted/further due to the knock-out barrier, hence higher precepted yield (e.g. was 70% of spot price)
- KnockOut features allow earlier 100% redemption if basket-of-and underlynig prices move above each strikes, each return is 30%
- similar to sell put at the same time and placing a deposit with the issuer(private bank)
- Opportunities to capture discounted prices with limited upside, with view prices will not fall below initial discounted prices
