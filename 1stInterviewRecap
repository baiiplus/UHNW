Knock-Out bull equity-linked bull note (Basket and KO

Key Risk

- Liquidity risk
- Price is slightly higher relative to single-equity-linked because strikes are basket-of-and conditioned, which has a slighty lower probability due to lower correlation or diversification effect
- Price is discounted/further due to the knock-out barrier, hence higher precepted yield (e.g. was 70% of spot price)
- KnockOut features allow earlier 100% redemption if basket-of-and underlynig prices move above each strikes, each return is 30%
- similar to sell put at the same time placing a deposit with the issuer(private bank)
